The video of it's very first and very unsteady steps into VCF web computing: [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXd_WsKa8o)

Development version in [GoogleDrive](https://www.googledrive.com/host/0BwwZEXS3GesiTjlHSmlOcEJaeDA/vcf/), without ever leaving the browser, thanks to Chrome's new [WorkSpace feature](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqfoYaKCYUI#t=3m39s). Now if only we could convince GitHub to be friendlier towards versioned webApp hosting ... (constructive suggestion from a thankful user: signing the SSL certificate would be a good start, and automatically recognizing the MIME types would be a fantastic follow up).
